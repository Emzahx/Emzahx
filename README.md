## About Me

Hey, I’m Emir but some call me Jake, it's a fun story so just ask me about it! I'm currently working towards becoming a **Certified Scrum Master** and **Agile Project Manager**—basically, I help teams work smarter, not harder, while also making sure no one misses their daily coffee break (or energy drink, if you're like me).

## Skills & Experience

### **Agile & Scrum**
- On a mission to become a **Certified Scrum Master** (CSM), so I can organize chaos and turn it into productive sprints—probably fueled by coffee (or *three*).
- Agile is my jam, and I live by the **Agile Manifesto**: "Deliver value, collaborate, and don’t let anyone forget their caffeine."

### **Web Development**
- I’ve got a solid grip on **HTML** and **CSS** thanks to building my own website (yes, it's real, and no, it's not just a placeholder).
- I’m all about clean, responsive design, with just the right amount of caffeine-fueled enthusiasm.

### **Website Deployment**
- Deployed my own website—because nothing says "I can handle the pressure" like pushing code to production on little more than **coffee** and **energy drinks**.
- Experienced with deployment platforms and tools, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the process (with maybe a few less jittery keystrokes).

## My Philosophy: The Agile Manifesto

I follow the Agile Manifesto like a roadmap to sanity—except I also believe it should include: **"Value caffeine over sleep"**. My goal? Delivering quality work, fostering collaboration, and making sure no one on the team ever runs out of coffee. (Or energy drinks. Let’s be real, I’m flexible.)
